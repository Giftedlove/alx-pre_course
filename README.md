My first readme  i want to commit to doing my best in all my projects, giving all the time i need to get every task. It has really not been easy but i will keep pushing untill i get to where i am supposed to be.
I want to appreciate everyone that has taken his or her time to guide and teach me on how to go about various task. I am really grateful for all the encouragements too.
